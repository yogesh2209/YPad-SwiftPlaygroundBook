# ESSAY 

We’ve come to the stage in which the app starts to take on a life of its own.
I wanted to do a little more, I created an iPad, I named it “YPad”. I
invite you to explore the “home button” and the easy accessibility of
“lock button” on the main page. I also created some apps for “YPad”
with the theme of life celebration, blasts the screen with colors,
bubbles, food, paint, and so on.
Then I realized that an “app” is first an icon on someone’s iPad. How it
looks and what that says about the app’s ultimate functions are
important to users, so I spent some time injecting personality into my
creations. The powerful usually overlooked framework “Core
Animation” was used to give life to my bubbles and confetti
animations.
You can start getting creative with my paint app; it offers many colors
created with UIPickerView. Additionally, UISlider allows thickness
adjustment of the pen and eraser.
Click the “YInfo” app, to meet the developer. It sheds some light on my life
such as my date of birth, education, research projects, and my
developed apps.
I also have a fun side; I am a PlayStation 4 fanatic, love eating fried
chicken, love my iPhone and Apple watch. “My Interests” app invites
you to get to know me. With a focus on healthy eating and fitness, my
last app is a diet predictor which predicts your meals according to the
calories you have already consumed in the day. Some other features
are used that I did not mention previously is “UIGestures” like tap and
swipe gesture, “AVFoundation” for audio, “UICollectionView” to list
the apps showing on the main page
I hope you will enjoy my YPad as much as I did in development.
